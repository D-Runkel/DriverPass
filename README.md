# DriverPass

The DriverPass System was created for Liam, the founder who reached out to us to create the system.

I believe that I did well on the UML diagrams included in the systems design document and presentation.

If I could revise some sections, I would refine technical requirements outlined in the business requirements document.

The User's needs are a top priority, because at the end of the day, quality software is our business. A bad company name loses us business.
Statisfying users needs is the most basic of things we can do. 

Approaching software design with logical patterns and designs based on in-use systems known to work is a good start. Adding user needs based on successful systems designs inspires innovation and allows for that successful design to be built upon and refined. Systems design is an ongoing process, from inception to final server shutdown.
